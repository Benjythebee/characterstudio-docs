# Mint

The `MintComponent` is a React component that provides the functionality for minting a digital asset. In layman's terms, it's like a factory machine interface where you can create your own unique digital item (like a character in a game). This component handles the process of creating the item, showing the status of the creation process, and providing buttons to navigate to other parts of the application.

**Imports**

The component imports several dependencies, including styles, contexts, a custom button component, and a utility function for minting assets.

```jsx!
import React from "react"
import styles from "./Mint.module.scss"
import { ViewMode, ViewContext } from "../context/ViewContext"
import { SceneContext } from "../context/SceneContext"
import CustomButton from "../components/custom-button"
import { SoundContext } from "../context/SoundContext"
import { AudioContext } from "../context/AudioContext"
import { mintAsset } from "../library/mint-utils"
```

**Component Definition**

The `MintComponent` is a functional component that takes a `getFaceScreenshot` prop. It uses several contexts to get and set various application states.


```jsx!
function MintComponent({getFaceScreenshot}) {
  const { templateInfo, model, avatar } = React.useContext(SceneContext)
  const { setViewMode } = React.useContext(ViewContext)
  const { playSound } = React.useContext(SoundContext)
  const { isMute } = React.useContext(AudioContext)
  ...
}
```


**State Variables**

The component uses two state variables: `status` to store the current status of the minting process, and `minting` to store whether the minting process is currently ongoing.

```jsx!
const [status, setStatus] = React.useState("")
const [minting, setMinting]= React.useState(false)
```

**Functions**

The component defines several functions:

- `back` and `next` are used to navigate to other views in the application.
- `MenuTitle` is a sub-component that renders the title of the menu.
- `Mint` is an asynchronous function that handles the minting process.

```jsx!
const back = () => {...}
const next = () => {...}
function MenuTitle() {...}
async function Mint(){...}
```

**Render**

The component returns a JSX structure that includes:

- A title for the section.
- A container for the minting process, which includes the `MenuTitle` sub-component, two `CustomButton` components for the minting options, and a status message.
- A container for navigation buttons.

```jsx!
return (
  <div className={styles.container}>
    ...
  </div>
)
```

**Export**

Finally, the `MintComponent` is exported for use in other parts of the application.

```jsx!
export default MintComponent
```
