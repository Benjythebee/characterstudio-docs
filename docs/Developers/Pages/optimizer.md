# Optimizer

The `Optimizer` component is a part of a React application that provides an interface for users to optimize their 3D character models. Users can drop their character files into the component, which then processes the file, optimizes it, and allows the user to download the optimized version. The component also provides options for merging and creating texture atlases, and displays information about the current model.

In layman's terms, this component is like a workshop for 3D character models. Users can bring their models in, tweak some settings, and then get a more optimized version of their model to use in their projects.

**Imports**

The component imports various hooks from React, styles, contexts, components, and utility functions from different modules.

```jsx!
import React, { useContext, useEffect, useState } from "react"
import styles from "./Optimizer.module.css"
import { ViewMode, ViewContext } from "../context/ViewContext"
import { SceneContext } from "../context/SceneContext"
import CustomButton from "../components/custom-button"
import { LanguageContext } from "../context/LanguageContext"
import { SoundContext } from "../context/SoundContext"
import { AudioContext } from "../context/AudioContext"
import FileDropComponent from "../components/FileDropComponent"
import { getFileNameWithoutExtension, disposeVRM, getAtlasSize } from "../library/utils"
import ModelInformation from "../components/ModelInformation"
import MergeOptions from "../components/MergeOptions"
import { local } from "../library/store"
```

**Component Definition**

The `Optimizer` component is defined as a functional, no props are required.

```jsx!
function Optimizer() {
  // Component body
}
```

**State and Context**

The component uses several pieces of state and context to manage its behavior and data.

```jsx!
const { 
    isLoading, 
    setViewMode 
} = React.useContext(ViewContext)
const {
    characterManager,
    animationManager,
    sceneElements,
    loraDataGenerator,
    spriteAtlasGenerator
} = React.useContext(SceneContext)
const { playSound } = React.useContext(SoundContext)
const { isMute } = React.useContext(AudioContext)

const [model, setModel] = useState(null);
const [nameVRM, setNameVRM] = useState("");
```
*characterManager* is the class that holds the logic to load/append vrm models and custom character manifests.

*animationManager* is the class that holds the logic to load animations to current loaded traits.

*sceneElements* all the elements within the scene that dont belong to the character traits.

*loraDataGenerator* is the class that holds the logic to create lora data from loaded vrm files.

*spriteAtlasGenerator* is the class that holds the logic to create 2d animated sprites and spritesheets from the currently loaded vrm files.




**Helper Functions**

Several helper functions are defined within the component to handle various tasks such as getting options, downloading the VRM, handling file drops, and more.

```jsx!
const back = () => { /* Function body */ }
const getOptions = () => { /* Function body */ }
const download = () => { /* Function body */ }
const handleAnimationDrop = async (file) => { /* Function body */ }
const handleVRMDrop = async (file) => { /* Function body */ }
const handleFilesDrop = async(files) => { /* Function body */ };
```

**useEffect Hook**

A `useEffect` hook is used to perform side effects when the `currentVRM` state changes.

```jsx!
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => { /* Function body */ }
  fetchData();
}, [currentVRM])
```

**Render**

The component returns a JSX structure that includes a loading indicator, a section title, a `FileDropComponent`, a `MergeOptions` component, a `ModelInformation` component, and a set of `CustomButton` components.


```jsx!
return (
  <div className={styles.container}>
    {/* JSX structure */}
  </div>
)
```

**Export**

Finally, the `Optimizer` component is exported for use in other parts of the application.

```jsx
export default Optimizer
```
