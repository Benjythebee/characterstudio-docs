# View

The `View` component is a part of a React application that handles the user interface for a chat feature. It uses various contexts to manage state and behavior, such as view mode, sound, audio, and language settings. The component also controls a microphone feature and speech recognition. In layman's terms, this component is like the control center for a chat room where users can interact with each other, and it manages how the chat room looks, sounds, and behaves.

**Imports**

```jsx!
import React, { useContext } from "react"
import styles from "./View.module.css"
import { ViewMode, ViewContext } from "../context/ViewContext"
import Chat from "../components/Chat"
import CustomButton from "../components/custom-button"
import { LanguageContext } from "../context/LanguageContext"
import { SoundContext } from "../context/SoundContext"
import { AudioContext } from "../context/AudioContext"
```

The component imports necessary modules, styles, and contexts. `useContext` is a React hook that allows the component to access the state and functions provided by the imported contexts.

**Component Function**

```jsx!
function View({templateInfo}) {
  ...
}
```

The `View` component receives `templateInfo` as a prop.


**State and Context**


```jsx!
const { setViewMode } = React.useContext(ViewContext)
const [micEnabled, setMicEnabled] = React.useState(false)
const [speechRecognition, setSpeechRecognition] = React.useState(false)
const { playSound } = React.useContext(SoundContext)
const { isMute } = React.useContext(AudioContext)
const { t } = useContext(LanguageContext);
```

The component uses several pieces of state and context:

- `setViewMode`: A function from `ViewContext` to change the view mode.
- `micEnabled` and `setMicEnabled`: State variables to manage the microphone status.
- `speechRecognition` and `setSpeechRecognition`: State variables to manage the speech recognition status.
- `playSound`: A function from `SoundContext` to play a sound.
- `isMute`: A state variable from `AudioContext` to check if the audio is muted.
- `t`: A function from `LanguageContext` to translate text.

**Back Function**

```jsx!
const back = () => {
  setViewMode(ViewMode.SAVE)
  !isMute && playSound('backNextButton');
  if (speechRecognition)
    speechRecognition.stop()
  setMicEnabled(false)
}
```


The `back` function changes the view mode to `SAVE`, plays a sound if audio is not muted, stops speech recognition if it's active, and disables the microphone.

**Render**

```jsx
return (
  ...
)
```

The component renders a chat interface with a title, a `Chat` component, and a `CustomButton` component. The `Chat` component receives several props related to the microphone and speech recognition. The `CustomButton` component is configured to act as a back button.

**Export**

```jsx
export default View
```

The `View` component is exported for use in other parts of the application.
